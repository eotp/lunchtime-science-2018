In order to re-run the code and Jupyter notebooks presented during the talk I recommend to use the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) package manager. Once installed, create an environment and install all required dependencies on your machine by typing 

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

into your console. You activate your new environment by typing 

`source activate lunchtime` (on LINUX and Mac) or

`activate lunchtime` (on WINDOWS). 

Then you are ready to go (if you are stuck check out the [conda documentation site](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)). Alternatively, you may launch [binder](https://mybinder.org/) to get a reproducible executable environment immediately in your browser. Simply click the _launch binder_ icon in the upper left corner, or go [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/eotp/lunchtime-science-2018/master?filepath=notebooks).
